# AI6's Brain-Computer Interfacing Research & Study Group

[Saturdays.AI](https://saturdays.ai) is a global initiative to democratize access to Artificial Intelligence education at the quality and rigour of the worldâ€™s best universities, in the form of 14-week bootcamps.

We've partnered with [Bitbrain](https://bitbrain.com), a leading world-class neurotechnology company, to explore projects at the intersection of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

This repository contains some of this exploratory work.

## The experiment

Our aim is to move objects "with our minds". Technically, we will gather EEG brainwaves using a Bitbrain 16-channel headset and we will create machine learning models to create classifiers capable of predicting the required actions to move motor-enabled objects such as electric wheelchairs or RC cars.

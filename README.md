# AI6's Brain-Computer Interfacing Research & Study Group

[Saturdays.AI](https://saturdays.ai) is a global initiative to democratize access to Artificial Intelligence education at the quality and rigour of the worldâ€™s best universities, in the form of 14-week bootcamps.

We've partnered with [Bitbrain](https://bitbrain.com), a leading world-class neurotechnology company, to explore projects at the intersection of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

This repository contains some of this exploratory work.

## The experiment

Our aim is to move objects "with our minds". Technically, we will gather EEG brainwaves using a Bitbrain 16-channel headset and we will create machine learning models to create classifiers capable of predicting the required actions to move motor-enabled objects such as electric wheelchairs or RC cars.

## How to contribute

To understand the project, read through the Jupyter notebooks in order. We're trying to keep them well documented and self-explainable.

PRs are welcome.

If you make contributions to a notebook, feel free to add yourself as one of the authors at the top of said notebook.

Adding Markdown cells to the notebooks to explain unclear things is always a plus, so feel free to add any necessary documentation.

Help is most likely specially needed with data science / artificial intelligence engineering at the most recent notebook. We try to keep this work updated so the last notebook will most likely reflect the current state of the project and where we're currently stuck at.

Please contact us with any questions!
